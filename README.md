# Air-Pollution-Forecasting-Analysis
This project provides an extensive analysis and model development for forecasting PM2.5 pollution concentrations in Beijing, China. PM2.5 particles are known for their adverse health impacts, contributing to respiratory diseases, cardiovascular issues, and other serious health conditions. Our goal was to identify the best forecasting model to accurately predict PM2.5 levels, providing reliable insights for public health advisories and policy-making.
In this study, we evaluated multiple time-series forecasting models, including ARIMA, VAR, Prophet, Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVR. XGBoost demonstrated the highest accuracy, effectively handling non-linear dependencies and multivariate interactions. This report details the methods, results, and key insights, providing a foundation for using predictive modeling in real- time air quality management.
